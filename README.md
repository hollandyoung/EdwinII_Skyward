Edwin II: Skyward

Edwin II: Skyward is a simple strategy game made using the Unity Engine for the 2024 Game Maker's Toolkit (GMTK) Game Jam by a team of four developers and a musical contributor. A browser-playable version of the project can be found at https://sadless.itch.io/edwin-ii-skyward.

The theme of GMTK Game Jam 2024 was "Built to scale;" Edwin II: Skyward interprets this theme by centering the main gameplay loop around constructing (building) different structures on either side of a giant weight scale positioned at the top of a tower, which you also "build" as the game goes on. The game plays as an economic management strategy game in which you attempt to optimize your buildings to produce bricks—the game's currency unit—most efficiently.

There are 5 types of structures you can place on open slots on either side of the weight scale: houses, cheap units that provide slow brick generation; kilns, which produce exponentially more bricks the more agoras are placed in the same row or column as the kiln; agoras, which produce nothing on their own but are used to boost kilns; columns, which provide scaffolding so that the player can build upward; and platforms, which work with columns to allow players to build more structures on higher layers. Bricks are also necessary to build up the tower that the weight scale sits atop of, as there is an additional "tide" mechanic that ends the game if the rising tide ever makes contact with the weight scale.

The project used jsfxr for sound effect generation and sources its font to Style-7 found at https://www.fontspace.com/serif-pixel-7-font-f16130.
